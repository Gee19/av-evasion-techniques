* How do we bypass scantime detection to get our ~evil_binary~ on the victims PC?

    Loader: ~Downloads malicious binary in encrypted form~
    Dynamic compilation: ~Downloads encrypted source code and compiles it dynamically~

* Usually some form of symmetric encryption, but how do we run encrypted code?

* Once our code is run how do we avoid raising alarms?

    ~SSL/TLS is a good start for avoiding packet snooping~
    ~Encrypting files dropped to disk sounds smart~
    ~CryptProtectMemory could work but is most likely being monitored~
