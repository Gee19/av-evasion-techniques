% RunPE, PE Injection or Code Injection

* More advanced stubs will utilize a RunPE (portable executable) method.

* Suspend -> Inject -> Resume
    ~Create new instance of stub process in suspended state~
    ~Inject the evil bytecode into the process memory~
    ~Move address of entry point to eax register~
    ~Resume process/call main()~

This is just one example, there are alternative methods like injecting into existing processes and utilizing:
    ~CreateRemoteThread~
    ~NtCreateThreadEx~

Note: this is harder if UAC is enabled
