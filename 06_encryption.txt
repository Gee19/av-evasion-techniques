% Encryption (not obfuscation)

Obfuscation
  ~Doesn't really solve run-time scanning~
  ~Most AVs will flag based on imported libraries~

* We can encrypt a binary but to run it we need some way to decrypt and run it on execution.

* Stub has joined the chat.

* Think of a stub like a small binary that runs standalone, decrypts something and runs it (usually in memory).

* Usually a program (crypter) will accept a binary, encrypt it and generate a stub to execute the supplied binary.

* Effective at evading scan-time detection, but once decrypted in memory it could be detected.
