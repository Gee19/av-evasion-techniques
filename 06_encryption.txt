% Encryption

* This can be interpreted in various ways

* We can obfuscate code but that doesn't really solve run-time scanning.

* We can encrypt a binary but to run it we need some kind of load step.

* Think of a stub like a small binary that runs standalone, decrypts something and runs it in memory.

    ~def stub(some_encrypted_bytecode):~
    ~  secret_key = 'hunter2' # Autogenerated per binary~
    ~  decrypt_and_run(some_encrypted_bytecode)~

* Usually a program will accept a binary and generate a stub to execute the supplied binary.

* Varying levels of effectiveness, ranging from useless to scan-time evasion and sometimes even run-time evasion.
