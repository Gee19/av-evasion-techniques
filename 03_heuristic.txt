% Heuristic Based Detections

* AV specific

* Example heuristics based on win32 function calls:
    CallNextHookEx: ~Common in userland keyloggers~
    LoadLibraryA: ~Common in run-time DLL injection~
    WriteProcessMemory: ~Common in RunPE methods~

* ~False positives!~

* Again, easily circumvented by encryption (at scantime)
