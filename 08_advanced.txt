* Chaining of methods

* UAC bypass
    ~Utilize a priviledged application to execute our malicious one~
    ~Enter eventvwr.exe~
    ~Reads HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command~
    ~Executes the binary at this path if it exists~
    ~With root perms and within the same process (snap-in)~

* IAT patching or hijacking

* Before
    ~target program calls a WinAPI MessageBoxA function~
    ~the program looks up the MessageBoxA address in the IAT~
    ~code execution jumps to the kernel32!MessageBoxA address resolved in step 2~

* After
    ~the target program calls MessageBoxA like before hooking~
    ~program looks up the MessageBoxA address in the IAT~
    ~IAT has been tampered with, the MessageBoxA address in the IAT is pointing to a rogue hookedMessageBox function~
    ~the program jumps to the hookedMessageBox retrieved in step 3~
    ~hookedMessageBox intercepts the MessageBoxA parameters and executes some malicous code~
    ~hookedMessageBox calls the legitimate kernel32!MessageBoxA routine~

* Can also be used to hide our malicious process from AVs watchful eye
    ~Hooking NtQuerySystemInformation~
