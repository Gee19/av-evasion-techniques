% Well what do AVs actually do?

* Network scans

* Firewall stuff

* Real-time IO scanning (shoutout to ESET for inspiring this talk)
  • ~Scan-time (Static)~
    • File open – Scans when a file is opened.
    • File creation – Scans a created or modified file.

  • ~Run-time (Dynamic)~
    • File execution – Scans when a file is executed or run

* Usually detections come in two varieties:
  • ~Signature based~
  • ~Heuristic based~

  * We will focus on scan-time in the next few slides for simplicity
